# AP2-social-chat-app
In this assignment we built and designed the structure of our chat application using only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. <br>
We named our app "yesh-chat". So far it consists of a login page, a registration page and the main chat page. <br>
Running the code is through any browser, just open the HTML files in your browser of choice. <br>
We will start to insert some functionality and logic in the next assignment.
