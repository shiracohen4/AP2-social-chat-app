## What's new?
In this assignment we have turned the web UI from the previous assignment into a React app and added some functionality to it using JavaScript and React.
* The code is now divided into React components so that each component has its own functionality
* Users are now able to register, pick a unique username and log in to the app using their personal password
* Registration is only possible when filling out the fields according to the limitations we have set
* The chats page is protected, so that users who are not logged in cannot access it
* Users can add new contacts which will appear in their contact list on the left
* When clicking a contact, a chat with them appears on the right and messages can be sent (but not recieved, as for this assignment)
* After logging out, contacts and messages are not saved
